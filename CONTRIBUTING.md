# Contributing Guidelines

Make a pull request

There are **two** ways you can contribute your resources to this repository - [Suggesting a Resource][suggesting] and [Making a Change to the Code][change]. We recommend going with the second option, as this will help you with future projects

- [Suggesting a Resource](#make-a-suggestion)
- [Committing a Resource](#commit)

- Add single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- Pull request title should include resource name and resource section.

  - Example: `[Tailwind CSS] -> [CSS Frameworks]`

- Provide a link to submitted resource in pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.

  - Example: `Link: https://tailwindcss.com/`

- Double check if the resource is truly free without any kind of hidden surprises.

We welcome everyone to help contribute, so if the previous instructions were a little too much for right now, here's how else you can submit a suggestion.

1. Go to the [Pull requests][pull-requests] tab and click on `New pull request`
