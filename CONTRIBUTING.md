[Back to Resources](/README.md)

# Contributing Guidelines

There are **two** ways you can contribute your resources to this repository - [Adding](#adding-a-resource) and [Suggesting](#suggesting-a-resource). We recommend trying to add a resource first, as this will help you with making contributions to future projects that use this process.

_If you wish to use the GitHub Desktop app, please use [this page](./docs/github-desktop.md) instead._

**In order to follow these instructions, you will need [git][git-introduction] on your machine. [See here][git-install] for how to install it.**

## Adding a resource

Similar to [First Contributions][first-contributions], this project is intended to help beginners share resources they have found on their learning journey. The following steps are from the First Contributions repository so as to be as clear as possible. We also highly recommend checking out their project to add another contribution to your belt!

### Step 1: Fork web-dev-resources repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### Step 2: Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

### Step 3:

## Suggesting a resource

We welcome everyone to help contribute, so if the previous instructions were a little too much for right now, here's how else you can submit a suggestion.

1. Go to the [Pull requests][pull-requests] tab and click on `New pull request`
2. Add `one` resource per pull request in the following format: `[Category] - [Resource] - [Description]`
3. On a new line, provide a link to the resource `e.g. https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp`

The final result should look something like this:

```
Open Source - GitHub Guide - Documentation to help guide you through everything open source

https://opensource.guide/
```
