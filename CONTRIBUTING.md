# Contribution Guidelines

Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing! At first it may seem an overwhelming volume of new terms and commands, but don't be put off by this.

Below is a full guide, with step-by-step instructions to help you make contributions. The skills you will learn from this can be applied to a number of

Remember, contributing to open source is a learning experience. Don't be afraid to ask questions, seek help, or make mistakes. We're all here to help each other learn and grow as contributors. Happy contributing!

## Getting Started

Git and GitHub will both be required to continue with the following steps. There are a [collection of resources](README.md/#git--github) in the README that can help you understand these tools.

`Git` is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same codebase, keeping track of changes and enabling collaboration.

> Please make sure you have installed Git on your machine before continuing. Some computers will have it built in, but if you can't find it, you can download for [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) or [Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

`GitHub` is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, making it easier for individuals and teams to collaborate on and manage their code projects.

> If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up for one now so that you can become a contributor. It is free to do and can be found in the navigation bar.

## Step 1: Fork the `web-dev-resources` repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Step 2: Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.
