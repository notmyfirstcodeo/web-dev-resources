Thank you for your interest in contributing to `web-dev-resources`! It may seem overwhelming when you are first starting to use `git` and `GitHub`, but we have tried to detail the steps as clearly as possible. For some topics, we have provided links to further details.

> We have no affiliation or association with any of the resources in the guide. Please do not add sponsored links or referral links - all resources should have the majority of content available for free.

There are **two** ways you can contribute your resources to this repository - [Adding](#adding-a-resource) and [Suggesting](#suggesting-a-resource). We recommend trying to add a resource first, as this will help you with making contributions to future projects that use this process.

_If you wish to use the GitHub Desktop app, please use [this page](./docs/github-desktop.md) instead._

**In order to follow these instructions, you will need [git][git-introduction] on your machine. [See here][git-install] for how to install it.**

## Adding a resource

Similar to [First Contributions][first-contributions], this project is intended to help beginners share resources they have found on their learning journey. The following steps are from the First Contributions repository so as to be as clear as possible. We also highly recommend checking out their project to add another contribution to your belt!

### Step 3:

## Suggesting a resource

We welcome everyone to help contribute, so if the previous instructions were a little too much for right now, here's how else you can submit a suggestion.

1. Go to the [Pull requests][pull-requests] tab and click on `New pull request`
2. Add `one` resource per pull request in the following format: `[Category] - [Resource] - [Description]`
3. On a new line, provide a link to the resource `e.g. https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp`

The final result should look something like this:

```
Open Source - GitHub Guide - Documentation to help guide you through everything open source
